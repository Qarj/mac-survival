## Dock

To move the dock (taskbar) between displays, move the mouse to the very bottom of the display and hold it there.

Better still, move the Dock to the left or right side of the screen. This is a better use of space and makes it easier to move windows between displays. The Dock won't automatically move to the other display when you move the mouse to the edge of the screen, but you can move it manually.
